Deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud
To deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud:

Prepare Files:

Ensure app.py and requirements.txt are in the root directory (e.g., studyfluence-app).


Set Up GitHub Repository:

Initialize a Git repository if not already done:git init
git add app.py requirements.txt
git commit -m "Initial deployable StudyFluence app"


Create a new repository on GitHub and push:git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main




Deploy:

Visit Streamlit Community Cloud.
Sign in with your GitHub account.
Click "New app" and connect to your repository.
Set the branch to main and the main file path to /app.py.
Click "Deploy" and monitor the build log for any issues.


Access:

Once deployed, use the provided URL to access the app. Note that session state resets on redeployment; persistent data requires a backend integration (e.g., SQLite).



Requirements

Dependencies: streamlit>=1.22.0 and pandas>=1.5.0 (both supported on Streamlit Community Cloud).
Python: 3.8 or higher.

Notes

Session State: Data (e.g., discussions, sessions) persists during a session but resets on redeployment. For production, integrate a database.
Resource Usage: The app is lightweight, with no heavy computations or external API calls beyond CSV export.
Error Handling: Includes validation to prevent crashes (e.g., empty inputs).
Customization: Enhance with a backend for persistent data or additional features like AI Q&A (currently simulated).
